        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          1.1&nbsp;<em>Services Use.</em> During the Term, iNotebook will provide
          the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLAs, and
          Customer may use the Services, and integrate the Services into any
          Customer Application that has material value independent of the
          Services, in accordance with the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          1.2&nbsp;<em>Admin Console.</em> Customer will have access to the Admin
          Console, through which Customer may manage its use of the Services.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          1.3&nbsp;<em>Accounts.</em> Customer must have an Account to use the
          Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create
          the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any
          use of its Account. iNotebook has no obligation to provide multiple
          accounts to Customer.

          (a)&nbsp;<em>To the Services.</em> iNotebook may make commercially
          reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. iNotebook will
          inform Customer if iNotebook makes a material change to the Services
          that has a material impact on Customer's use of the Services provided
          that Customer has subscribed with iNotebook to be informed about such
          change.

          (b)&nbsp;<em>To the Agreement.</em> iNotebook may make changes to this
          Agreement (including the URL Terms) and pricing from time to time.
          Unless otherwise noted by iNotebook, material changes to the Agreement
          will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except to the
          extent the changes apply to new functionality or the Cloud Data
          Processing Addendum, or are required by applicable law, in which case
          they will be effective immediately. iNotebook will provide at least 90
          days' advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by (i)
          sending an email to the Notification Email Address; (ii) posting a
          notice in the Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable
          SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement,
          Customer may stop using the Services. Customer may also terminate this
          Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for
          Convenience). Customer's continued use of the Services after such
          material change will constitute Customer's consent to such changes.

          discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service
